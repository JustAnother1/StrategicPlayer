Strategic Player
----------------

Implementations of AI Game Players.


HOW TO BUILD?
-------------
I've provided a simple ant build script.
So running with ant installed should be a simple:

+$ ant+

+$ java -jar StrategicPlayer.jar+

It depends on the Strategic Client Library. Please compile it and place the StrategicClientLib.jar into the lib/ folder.
